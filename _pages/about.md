I am an Instructor in the Foundational Development Directorate at Sabancı University. I received my Ph.D. from Sabancı University in 2020. I also had the opportunity to work as a visiting researcher at the Michael Nicholson Center for Conflict and Cooperation at the University of Essex

My primary research interests revolve around civil wars, non-violent protests, and the use of foreign policy tools. My dissertation project specifically focuses on the statements made by external actors regarding civil conflicts. While the dissertation aimed to identify the factors influencing more resolved leader statements, I am currently engaged in research to better understand how these verbal cues impact the strategies of conflict actors.
