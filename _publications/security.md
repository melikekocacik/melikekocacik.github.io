This paper seeks to explore how past experiences impact the
credibility of external states and change their public statements
regarding other civil conflicts. While existing research on thirdparty intervention often explores the reasons behind external
states’ involvement in conflicts, there has been a notable
oversight in understanding how verbal expressions evolve across
diverse conflicts. The paper compares the United States’
presidential statements regarding the Bosnia and Kosovo conflicts
and highlights how the United States employs different frames
for these distinct conflicts to restore its credibility. The paper
concludes by proposing the need for a new measure of thirdparty attitudes towards civil conflicts to gain a more nuanced
understanding of the role of external states in civil conflicts by
measuring their resolve.
